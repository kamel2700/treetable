# treetable
``A user can create and browse their “projects” - structures
of nice things, say, in your house or at your workplace.``

``Each project consists of tree-organized entities of
different types - nodes (e.g. rooms, lockers, shelves and
finally items).``

``The intention of the app is to help organize your inventory
(and everything else that can be structured).``
